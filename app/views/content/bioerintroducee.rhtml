      The predecessor of BIOER is R&D department of Ferrotec China. With the development of business, BIOER became an independent company departing from Ferrotec Group (China) in 2002. Ferrotec is one of the largest high-quality Peltier suppliers in the world.<br/><br/>
      Based on its own unique manufacturing background subject to Peltier and skilled design capability, BIOER started from 1995 on the R&D of peltier applications. Bioer launched the first thermal cycler (PCR instrument) in China based on peltier technology in 1998. Fully met the international advanced level, it passed the identification of Zhejiang Drug Administration, and won the registration certificate of medical devices, and got the patent issued by the state. BIOER compiled the first enterprise standard subject to thermal cycler in China. Later, BIOER launched TC series PCR instruments, as well as Line-Gene Series Real-time PCR instruments. Among them, Line-Gene fluorescence quantitative PCR detection system is launched and won the national invention patent (Patent No.: ZL 01 1 16421.2) in 2002, which is the first real-time PCR instrument approved by China's State Food and Drug Administration. With its stable, reliable and sensitive performance, Line-Gene series instruments were recognized by the market soon, thus to guarantee a total order quantity nearly 1,000 units, and develop into the classic technology platform for Real-time PCR Series products of BIOER.

      Besides PCR series products, BIOER launched related instruments such as cooling & heating series, nucleic acid purification system, standard PCR lab, shaking incubator, gel electrophoresis, water bath, and outer-cycler chiller subsequently. BIOER set a reagent manufacturing dept. in 2002, in order to set foot in R&D, production, sales and services for reagents in the field of life science research and application, and applied to create an integrated solutions-oriented enterprise for full range of research and application. In 2007, HBV PCR Fluorescence Quantitative Detection Kit which was developed and produced by BIOER, won the certificate issued by China’s SFDA ( No. : 3401340 [2007] ).
